    <h2>How It Works</h2>
    <p>At the heart of Amalgam8, are two multi-tenanted services:</p>


    <div class="section__row">
      <div>
        <h3>Registry</h3>
        <p>A high performance service registry that provides a centralized view of all the microservices in an application, regardless of where they are actually running</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Controller</h3>
        <p>Monitors the Registry and provides a REST API for registering, routing, and other microservice control-rules, which it uses to generate and send control information to proxy servers running within the application.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

          1. Register
          Microservice instances are registered in the A8 Registry. There are several ways this may be accomplished.
        </p>
        <p>2. Routing Rules and Filters
          Administrator specifies routing rules and filters (e.g., version rules, test delays) to control traffic flow between microservices.
        </p>
        <p> 3. Proxy Control
          A8 Controller monitors the A8 Registry and administrator input and then generates control information that is sent to the A8 Proxies.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p>4. Request
          Requests to microservices are via an A8 Proxy (usually a client-side sidecar of another microservice).</p>
        <p>5. Route
          A8 Proxy forwards request to an approriate microservice, depending on the request path and headers and the configuration specified by the controller.</p>
        <p>The A8 service registration sidecar component is used to register and continuously send heartbeats to the registry on behalf of a microservice instance. This
            is a common registration design pattern used in many microservice frameworks, and will work for services running anywhere.</p>
