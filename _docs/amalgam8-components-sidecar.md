The Almagam8 sidecar has a flexible architecture that can be configured and
used by applications in a number of ways. The sidecar can be split into the
following functional components:

![sidecar architecture](/docs/figures/amalgam8-sidecar-components.svg)

* **Service Registration** - Registers a microservice instance in the Registry and sends periodic heartbeats.
* **Route Management** - Receives route updates from the Controller and updates the Proxy without disruption.
* **Supervisor** - Manages the lifecycle of an Amalgam8 Proxy server and optionally the associated microservice itself.
* **Proxy** - An [OpenResty-based Nginx](https://openresty.org/en/) server  that acts as a request forwarder and load-balancer.
